Charitable deductions reduce the public coffers by about 60 billion dollars a year… So it is fair to ask what should constitute a charity.”</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\nTalking about he Mormon church:<br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>“They provide food during famines and wheelchairs to the lame. But that’s not their main concern. Which is, like any business, growing the business, opening branches, selling more product, putting asses in tabernacles. General Electric plants a tree every now and then, it doesn’t make them Johnny Appleseed.”</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\nThat is a very good point, not just about the Mormons, but about ANY religious organization that does good works not to help others, but to provide a charitable camouflage while pimping their religion, their God, or just to get you to listen for a few minutes while they scare the crap out of you about what will happen to you if you DON'T embrace their faith.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9361564-769164485296422706?l=theimmoralminority.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>"

Now it looks like some of those funds might also need to go to legal bills.</p>\n<p>Tenthbit is getting sued by <a href="http://www.pair.com">pair Networks</a>, a hosting and domain registration company based in Pittsburgh, for trademark infringement.</p>\n<p>Tenthbit, meanwhile, has also sued pair Networks, to prevent the other suit from going ahead. Pair Networks is asking for an injunction on Pair the app, as well as “other relief as this Court deems appropriate.” Tenthbit argues the two do not compete directly, and would therefore not result in any brand confusion.</p>\n<p>While trademark cases can be a dime a dozen — and there is no guarantee of how this one will fall — this one is interesting for a few reasons:</p>\n<p>One is that it pits a startup working at the forefront of mobile social networking, against the kind of Internet company that has been around for years and is not so much about disruption as it is about making the internet work like it’s supposed to.</p>\n<p>Another is that this old-school Internet company has apparently taken others to court for the same reason — and won. And there a couple of other twists to this story, as you’ll see below.</p>\n<p>Tenthbit’s case against pair Networks was filed first, in a U.S. District Court in the District of Northern California, San Jose,&nbsp;on April 6 in an apparent attempt to stop pair Networks from filing its own case. That didn’t seem to work, and pair Networks filed its own case against Tenthbit in a Federal court in Pennsylvania on April 27. Both suits are embedded below.</p>\n<p>Pair Networks alleges in its suit that Tenthbit “doubly infringes” on pair Network’s trademark through both the use of the brand “Pair” as well as its URL, <a href="http://www.trypair.com">www.trypair.com</a>. Pair Networks says that it has spent “substantial amounts of time, effort, and money” to ensure that the public associates the Pair family of marks (these include pair.com, pair.net, and pair.org, among others)&nbsp;with its own company.</p>\n<p>Pair Networks, founded in 1998, offers its services both in the U.S. as well as internationally and claims to be one of the world’s biggest privately-held hosting companies. It says it delivers more than one billion Web hits per day via its servers.</p>\n<p>Pair the app, meanwhile, has seen over 220,000 downloads since it went live in the app store a month ago.</p>\n<p>Pair Networks says that it has been policing for the use of its name by Internet-related companies for years now, and cites three different examples in its complaint where courts have ruled in its favor in other trademark infringement cases.</p>\n<p>For its part, Tenthbit maintains that it is not in the same business as pair Networks — with a consumer mobile app being on the opposite end of the Internet spectrum from offering hosting and domain registration services to websites.</p>\n<p>“It is axiomatic and commonplace that the same word may be used as a trademark by different parties provided that such use does not create a likelihood of confusion on the part of relevant consumers,” the app makers’ lawyers, <a href="http://www.orrick.com/">Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe</a>, write in response to the infringement claims.</p>\n<p>There are a few other eyebrow-raising points in pair Networks’ complaint against Tenthbit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pair Networks claims that its reputation is being damaged because Pair the app is associated with “explicit adult activity” like “sexting.” (The suit doesn’t mention the spinoffs that Pair has spawned, such as <a href="http://pairmixer.com/">PairMixer</a>, which helps you find someone to pair with on the app if you are unattached.)</li>\n<li>Weird coincidence: Pair Networks claims that Tenthbit possibly already knew about pair Networks when it had registered its own domain as trypair.com because it turns out that among the companies hosted by pair Networks is Y Combinator, the incubator where Tenthbit created and launched Pair. Y Combinator used pair Networks for hosting for at least six years.</li>\n<li>Pair Networks is asking to get all the profits that Tenthbit will have made from Pair the app. (It’s a free app, with no revenue-generating services incorporated into it at this point.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cases are due to be heard later this year. We have reached out to Pair, pair Networks and their legal teams for further comment.</p>\n<p>Pair’s $4.2-million seed funding round, announced on May 1, came from an A-list of angels that included Ashton Kutcher’s A-Grade Ventures, Dave Morin, Paul Buchheit,&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/yuri-milner-dave-morin-sv-angel-crunchfund-and-more-hook-up-pair-with-4-2m/foundercollective.com">Founder Collective</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/yuri-milner-dave-morin-sv-angel-crunchfund-and-more-hook-up-pair-with-4-2m/svangel.com">SV Angel</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/yuri-milner-dave-morin-sv-angel-crunchfund-and-more-hook-up-pair-with-4-2m/lererventures.com">Lerer Ventures</a>, Michael Birch, Sam Altman,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/crunchfund">CrunchFund</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/yuri-milner-dave-morin-sv-angel-crunchfund-and-more-hook-up-pair-with-4-2m/tencent.com">Tencent</a>, Yuri Milner,<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/yuri-milner-dave-morin-sv-angel-crunchfund-and-more-hook-up-pair-with-4-2m/betaworks.com">Betaworks</a>, Alexis Ohanian, Garry Tan, Harjeet Taggar, Gary Vaynerchuk, Brandee Barker, Brian Pokorny, Elad Gil, and Susan Wu.</p>\n<iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/92543775/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=list&amp;access_key=key-qgz0vxfa6mv6k33ovh1" data-auto-height="true" scrolling="no" id="scribd_92543775" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: center; width: 100%;"><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/92543775">View this document on Scribd</a></div>\n<iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/92544486/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=list&amp;access_key=key-bs0d0qsxlsvrba5jzav" data-auto-height="true" scrolling="no" id="scribd_92544486" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n<div style="font-size: 10px; text-align: center; width: 100%;"><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/92544486">View this document on Scribd</a></div>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/e7Nx2ThylHJE6MMKdemxApusHVw/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/e7Nx2ThylHJE6MMKdemxApusHVw/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/e7Nx2ThylHJE6MMKdemxApusHVw/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/e7Nx2ThylHJE6MMKdemxApusHVw/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/sq_Okv5Bch0" height="1" width="1" />'

"Joe McGinniss has rented the house next to the Palin family's lakeside home in Wasilla, Alaska, for five months while he completes his work," reported this paper's website in May 2010.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>"Palin did everything she could to stop it," says McGinniss. "She threatened. She had a lawyer announce she was considering a lawsuit." That didn't happen. But within weeks of publication, Palin announced she would not be running in 2012.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>McGinniss is far from claiming sole responsibility. As he sees it, Palin faced two problems running for the Republican nomination this year: she didn't have a hope of winning and any attempt would expose her to the sort of scrutiny that would put at risk her lucrative new career as a political celebrity.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>"These people worked out a way to game the system," McGinniss says of the Palin family. "I don't blame them. They are just grifters who suddenly saw a chance at the main chance and they were clever enough and canny enough to take it. The American media was so gullible and the right wing was so desperate for new heroic figures that they basically got a free ride. She knew she wouldn't get a free ride this year in 2012."&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>His attack on Palin is full throttle. "I think everything about her is false. I think her claims of super Christianity are as false as everything else. She discovered who she needed to be to play to a very small audience in her town of Wasilla and she has calculated her way every step of the way. There has been an opening for a woman of the extreme right. She saw that.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>"Even in Alaska there were no openings for educated, intelligent women of the left because Alaska - part of the anomaly that is the state - had a number of those already. What they needed was a militant crusader for evangelical values. And she combined - and we can never underestimate this - raw sex appeal with Christian platitudes. The Anchorage Daily News called her 'The Joan of Arc of Alaska politics'. There was nothing subtle about it."&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>What followed in his eyes was a tale of cunning and vengeance; high ambition and lazy performance; bobsleds and cocaine; a toxic marriage that saw Todd sleeping on the couch most nights and the kids roaming the neighbourhood looking for a feed. Then young Track was shunted off to the military after the high-school bus fleet was mysteriously vandalised one winter.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>"I laughed," says McGinniss. "The closer I got and the more people I talked to who knew her, the more I laughed. After a while laughter gave way to a numb stupefaction that this brainless, venal, definitely crafty, religious fanatic and self-aggrandising bimbo could have become a powerful factor in national politics."&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\nThe Herald even asked Joe about the mystery of Trig:<br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>McGinniss devotes hilarious and scurrilous pages to the mystery of little Trig, the Down syndrome baby born soon after Palin won John McCain's endorsement. "The story she tells of her pregnancy and the birth simply can't be true," says McGinniss who wonders if the "birth" was designed to make Palin the poster child of the Right to Life.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>"It would be the most cynical ploy and the greatest hoax ever pulled off in American politics," he says. Pursuing the story with him are bloggers and the influential columnist Andrew Sullivan. But McGinniss despairs of the failure of the "establishment media" to take the story seriously. He doesn't believe the issue is yet settled either way: "I remain Trignostic," he says.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\nI have to say that I know Joe is FAR from Trognostic, but I also know that he was very frustrated that he was never able to crack open that particular part of the Palin mythology.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nStill he managed to bring the controversy to the forefront of the American audience for a short time, and may very well have been the MAIN reason why Palin has moved as far away from the political scene as she has recently.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nAnd now Joe will be in Australia this month to discuss this most scandalous of deceptions with an entirely new audience.&nbsp; And didn't "Sarah Palin-You Betcha!" just start appearing on Australian TV recently as well?<br />\015\n<br />\015\nWhy <a href="http://ozmud.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/sarah-palin-you-betcha-lands-in-sydney-australia-and-if-i-read-it-right-the-critics-like-neither-nick-nor-sarah/" target="_blank">yes it did</a>!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9361564-2337614346560820226?l=theimmoralminority.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>"

Follow her on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/etaooo">@etaooo</a></em>.</p>\n<p>For anyone who enjoys (or has a knack for) planning, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/31/hackathon-planning/">organizing a hackathon</a> is not terribly difficult: it’s a matter of understanding your goals, assessing needs, and figuring out how to bridge the two. Naturally, this is much easier said than done.</p>\n<p>The most important part of a hackathon, by far, are the demos. Why else — it’s what makes the event worth attending in the first place. Sponsoring companies wouldn’t offer money to anything that didn’t provide exposure. Developers wouldn’t forsake sleep if they couldn’t show an eager audience the hacks they built overnight.</p>\n<p>Pulling off demos at <a href="http://vimeo.com/31793064">Photo Hack Day</a> and <a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2012/02/21/aviary-photo-hack-day-two-general-assembly-berlin-02212012/">Photo Hack Day 2</a>, for example, has proven to be a continuous learning process, with a much more public (and much less forgiving) learning curve. There’s no need to be a n00b, I’ve done a lot of the screwing up for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Format</strong></p>\n<p>Almost every sponsored hackathon will have two sets of presentations: those that kick off the event (for sponsors to introduce developers to their APIs) and those that close it (for hackers to show what they’ve done). Since demos are the most visible component of the hackathon, ensuring that this portion runs smoothly is key to the overall opinion of the event’s success. The caveat: extensive preparation is useful to a certain degree. You can – and absolutely should – do a number of related tasks in advance, but a significant portion of hacker demos requires efficient, on-the-fly work that takes place within a short amount of time.</p>\n<p>Photo Hack Day 2 was organized almost entirely through three tools: email, spreadsheets, and <a href="http://hackerleague.org/">HackerLeague</a>. How you choose to keep track of everything is up to you, but I’d strongly suggest the following for each set of demos.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>Part I – API demos:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Keep a company database handy.&nbsp;</em>Any correspondence with a particular company should be labeled and filed away. It wouldn’t hurt to note how up-to-date companies are with their essential obligations, such as a cross-promotional blog post, whether or not they supplied a logo for the website, or when they paid any sponsorship dues. A CRM will help streamline the inbound and day-of workflow, but keeping everything in a consolidated document in a single browser window saves a significant amount of time compared to digging through archives. I’ve included a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AruC_fn-fSY0dHNCSkFPRkZidUd1MlN1alZHVzhKUlE">sample spreadsheet </a>where I organized the relevant information, and left a few examples of notes that I didn’t want to forget. (Note: the template is the same as what I used for both Photo Hack Days.)</li>\n<li><em>Encourage presenters to use layman’s terms for sake of efficiency.</em> If hackers are curious, they will approach a company developer and ask questions after a presentation is over. Being overly technical hampers presentation speed.</li>\n<li><em>Distribute guidelines on good presentations ahead of time.&nbsp;</em>As a rule of thumb, attendees and developers are generally fond of the following:&nbsp;Cool APIs, <a href="http://vimeo.com/40255931">funny</a> presentations and no PowerPoint.</li>\n<li><em>Establish time limits and follow the schedule.</em>&nbsp;Higher-level sponsors generally demo longer, and with more materials. Giving your headline company five minutes to speak in front of a captive audience with a laptop and projector is ample time; the next tier of sponsorship can have three minutes with a laptop and projector. Non-sponsors are allowed a one-minute pitch with a microphone, and can host non-mandatory demos and workshops during hacking hours instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>Part II – hack demos:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>…Clearly establish time limits</em> (yes, it’s important enough to mention twice.) – Unlike sponsors, each team of developers gets an equal amount of time to present. Two minutes is standard and a well-planned presentation can cover the high-level ins and outs of a hack in that much time.</li>\n<li><em>Ban Powerpoint if you have to</em> – This is also worth mentioning twice, because too many teams continue to try to use it. It may even be worth an explicit ban. It’s a waste of time and they can’t effectively showcase an app or service’s functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If companies are providing their own sponsored prizes, supply a list of hacks (and, if possible, the demo order) that can be filtered by API usage -</em>&nbsp;This enables them to know who to look out for; shareable spreadsheets on Google Docs are perfect for this.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><em>When s#*t breaks — and trust me, it will — have multiple spares on hand -</em>&nbsp;During Photo Hack Day 2’s Demo Day, we destroyed General Assembly’s two HDMI and VGA cables (they were taped to the floor underneath the audience chairs, so when people moved around, the cables were yanked from the wall and damaged). So, keep two or three spares of everything to keep the party going: electricity, Wi-Fi, presentation tools, dongles, cables, power strips, extension cords and even a projector! (Pro Tip: keep your receipts!)</li>\n<li><em>Prepare any relevant material for the judging panel -</em>&nbsp;Provide all judging criteria ahead of time and make this publicly available for attendees and hackers alike. Provide plenty of writing materials and judging templates (usually a list of hacks; this falls under the category of things you’ll need to create on the fly). Encourage judges to ask questions and push back on developer ideas – for instance, “Why did you do it like&nbsp;x&nbsp;when you could have done it like&nbsp;y?” If hackers can consolidate important development points in ten seconds or less, that will definitely win over technical judges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>To-do on the fly</strong></p>\n<p>Remember the aforementioned caveat? This is it, and it’s the trickiest, most stressful portion of the event.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Demo order – C</em>onsolidate signups into one place and by categorizing demos based on requisite equipment (i.e. live websites, locally-hosted applications, mobile apps). This will prevent you from having to scramble to find the appropriate cables / dongles every time a new person comes on deck. Test your platforms thoroughly; you’ll need to be very familiar with the sign-up procedure that your hackers will be relying upon.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If you’re using social media to post updates, create incentives for people to follow relevant feeds -</em>&nbsp;During Photo Hack Day 2, we posted most of the updates via Twitter with the #PHD2 hashtag. Everything seemed fine until the demo sign-up process was announced, both over the microphone and via Twitter but not everyone could hear us, nor were they checking Twitter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir="ltr">By creating incentives (i.e. sponsor giveaways to those who follow the feed, tweet about the event, or retweet any official posts), you gain a stronger following while making sure that hackers stay in the loop. This translates to a less chaotic process of organizing demos.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Voting process</em> – Whether you choose a web or mobile service, it helps to have SMS voting enabled. I say this because (1) I have yet to find a platform that I love to use on mobile browsers, and (2) most Demo Day attendees are not going to bring a laptop with them. Be sure to test it ahead of time to avoid hiccups.</li>\n<li><em>Prize ceremony -</em>&nbsp;If there are only official event prizes, the process should be easy enough: emcee as necessary, but allow judges to briefly talk the audience through some of their thoughts before delivering the verdict. For company prizes, be sure representatives know when to be onstage. Keep timeliness and brevity in mind. Feel free to relax now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br />\nHere’s what I still haven’t figured out</strong></p>\n<p><em>Should there be a cap to the number of&nbsp;demos?</em></p>\n<p>This has some very obvious pitfalls, but after four hours of demos, the judges and audience at Photo Hack Day 2 were equally exhausted. This translated to a rushed prize ceremony: it was getting dark, everyone had been at General Assembly since lunch, and hackers were beginning to shut down after a night without sleep.</p>\n<p>If judges and attendees are only interested in the high quality hacks, should there be some sort of screening process? The tradeoff for a large turnout is a long Demo Day, and you’d hate to end the event on a poor note (read: tired, grumpy hackers and attendees.)</p>\n<p><em>What alternatives exist to the monotony of demos? Is it worth dividing hack submissions into categories?</em></p>\n<p>After the hackathon (and a much-needed day off), our team broke down the areas where we thought there was room for improvement – and there were plenty. Though the demo tech mishaps were the most glaring, the actual process of demoing needed work.</p>\n<p>The consensus among a wide range of suggestions was to encourage (and more importantly, reward) creative and entertaining presentations with prizes; they provided a much-needed spell to monotonous ones. Good demos – especially those that are funny – make the entire afternoon worthwhile. In terms of condensing the block of time required for participants to demo, the jury is still out.</p>\n<p><strong>A final note</strong></p>\n<p>This is the summary of everything I’ve seen and experienced from the two hackathons I’ve organized, and the three cumulative months I’ve spent planning. There are certainly alternatives to all of these “methods”; a better way of approaching these things is to consider them variables. Trust that you understand the nature of your hackathon well enough to know what will work and what won’t.</p>\n<p>Yes, demos are time consuming, and yes, they are stressful, but I absolutely wouldn’t mind doing it all over again. For the developers who appreciate cool APIs, for anyone who loves observing the creative process, and for the many people out there concerned with building community: organizing these type of events is so gosh darn rewarding. Awesome people should meet awesome people, and awesome products beget even more awesome products.</p>\n<p>This, in a nutshell, is why we throw hackathons in the first place.</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/h7_2j_u3Z1wyrg-C_Pl1INERSts/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/h7_2j_u3Z1wyrg-C_Pl1INERSts/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/h7_2j_u3Z1wyrg-C_Pl1INERSts/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/h7_2j_u3Z1wyrg-C_Pl1INERSts/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/CFfOBGckAN8" height="1" width="1" />'

Scoble’s comment was specifically blocked because of its length, and the length of the comment thread it was on. Long and popular threads are particularly attractive to spammers as they provide the largest distribution for whatever content is being spammed. Facebook also may block other types of comments that go against positive conversation, such as some ASCII art. Other factors may include&nbsp;who you’re commenting on, how long the comment is, and who is commenting.</p>\n<p>Sentiment itself is not considered, the company says.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The wording is somewhat confusing, as “irrelevant or inappropriate” comments are a subjective judgement that could apply to many topics. But this doesn’t appear to be some sort of content filter that Facebook could tune to specific political content in order to get the social network approved to operate in certain countries like China. The company will be sending us an official statement soon and the specific reason Scoble’s comment was barred.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the company just told Scoble, which he’s commented (!) with further thoughts <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/05/facebooks-positive-comment-policy-irrelevant-inappropriate-censorship/?fb_comment_id=fbc_10150805467643389_21914691_10150806095053389">on our previous post</a>:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Facebook PR responds.</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I just talked with Facebook PR about my “comment censorship issue.” They say what actually happened is my comment was classified as spam. He further said that this was a “false positive” because my comment was one that Facebook doesn’t want to block.</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Turns out that my comment was blocked by Facebook’s spam classification filters and that it wasn’t blocked for what the comment said, but rather because of something unique to that message. They are looking more into it and will let me know more later, after they figure out what triggered it. Their thesis is that my comment triggered it for a few reasons:</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1. I’m subscribed to @max.woolf https://www.facebook.com/max.woolf and am not a friend of his in the system. That means that the spam classification system treats comments more strictly than if we were friends.</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>2. My comment included three @ links. That probably is what triggered the spam classification system.</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3. There might have been other things about the comment that triggered the spam system.</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The PR official I talked with told me that the spam classification system has tons of algorithms that try to keep you from posting low-value comments, particularly to public accounts (er, people who have turned on subscriptions here on Facebook).</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I actually appreciate that Facebook is trying to do something about comment quality. I had to recently change my privacy settings to only allow friends of friends to comment on my posts because I was getting so many poor comments on my posts (when I did that the poor quality posts instantly stopped).</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The PR person also said that a team is looking into why this message got a false positive, and will be adjusting the algorithms to let messages like these get through the system.</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also, the error message made it sound like the message was blocked because of the content of the message, not because it looked spammy. They are looking into the wording of the error and will update that to make the error clearer as to what’s going on and why the spam classification system got kicked in.</em></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>More as I learn more.</em></p>\n<p><em>[Image via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robinwauters/4634002184/sizes/m/in/photostream/">Robin Wauters/Flickr</a>.]</em></p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/X-Txu0GH4CsmyDzwtbS-U34yKSE/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/X-Txu0GH4CsmyDzwtbS-U34yKSE/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/X-Txu0GH4CsmyDzwtbS-U34yKSE/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/X-Txu0GH4CsmyDzwtbS-U34yKSE/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mJltPRomyag" height="1" width="1" />'
TechCrunch: '<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/chain_link_links.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="chain_link_links" title="chain_link_links" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>As we put more of our private information online and entrust it to web services, privacy breaches become almost inevitable. One major problem with online privacy is that there is really no enforceable chain of confidentiality. So when a third-party service makes your information available to another party, things can get complicated. A <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2045818">new paper</a> by Samford University law professor Woodrow Harzog argues that traditional privacy laws aren’t the best ways to protect private information online. Instead, he suggests an approach that’s more like the U.S. <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/">HIPAA rules</a> that currently govern how private health information can be shared between your health provider and third parties. The system he proposes would be based on established principles in confidentiality and contract law.</p>\n<p>Confidentiality law, says Harzog, typically only binds the first recipient of information. Online, that obviously isn’t enough to protect a user’s privacy and most scholars have argued that confidentiality law is simply not suited to deal with online privacy issues. Harzog, however, argues that a HIPAA-like “chain-link confidentiality” regime would be more effective in protecting users’ privacy than current regulations. This system would not just ensure confidentiality between the user and the first service where data is stored, but the obligation of confidentiality would also flow downstream. Under this regime, he writes, “Internet users could then pursue a remedy against anyone in the chain who either failed to abide by her obligation of confidentiality or failed to require confidentiality of a third-party recipient.”</p>\n<p>Harzog argues that our current privacy regulations are “a patchwork of laws and remedies” and often in conflict with other laws and evolving technologies. It’s also often unclear how “privacy” is actually defined and what, for example, constitutes a “reasonable expectations of privacy.” In Harzog’s view, “traditional privacy remedies are inadequate in the digital age.”</p>\n<p>Here is what chain-link confidentiality on the Internet would look like in practice: a website that collects your personal information (and that explicitly allow to share your information with other services) would also have to establish a confidentiality contract with any other company it discloses your information to – and those companies would be required to establish the same kind of contract with every subsequent recipient as well. These contracts, of course, could also simply prohibit any further dissemination of your personal information or limit it to certain companies or companies that fulfill certain security requirements. Every web service could, of course, also tweak this contract depending on its needs.</p>\n<p>In a way, this isn’t all that different from the Creative Commons “Share Alike” provision: depending on the Creative Commons license used – artist can allow others to remix their work, for example, as long as it is then shared under the same license terms as the original work.</p>\n<p>The chain-link confidentiality approach then would allow for the flow of information, says Harzog, ” by continually re-creating an environment for sharing that accommodates the sender, receiver, and the subject of the personal information.”</p>\n<p>Even though this isn’t a cure-all – your information, after all, could still leak out or be scraped by others – it’s an interesting way of looking at privacy from a more contractual point of view, especially because it sets up a legal framework for sharing information between services.</p>\n<p>For the more lawyerly and in-depth discussion of this, take a look at Harzog’s paper <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2045818">here</a>.</p>\n<p>[Image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yandle/4337747398/">Flickr user Yandle</a>]</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/U18e2HKKOwgoSJ_T13OqCCxKWFg/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/U18e2HKKOwgoSJ_T13OqCCxKWFg/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/U18e2HKKOwgoSJ_T13OqCCxKWFg/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/U18e2HKKOwgoSJ_T13OqCCxKWFg/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/TgKWPWfd2Z4" height="1" width="1" />'

Scoble’s comment itself was pretty par-for-the-course — generally agreeing with Woolf’s sentiments and adding in his own two cents.</p>\n<p>But when Scoble went to click post, he <a href="https://plus.google.com/111091089527727420853/posts/cdZQPUiMp9b">received an</a> odd error message:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This comment seems irrelevant or inappropriate and can’t be posted. To avoid having comments blocked, please make sure they contribute to the post in a positive way.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, Facebook makes no apologies for working to create a safe and clean environment on its corner of the web by shutting down <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2010/09/03/prevent-friend-request/">abusive or harassing behavior</a>, content <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=217396028308067">such as pornography</a>, or generally spamming of the system. This particular method policing “inappropriate” comments may be new, but it would fall within the same general realm.</p>\n<p>But even so, this instance seems to be a very strange enactment of any kind of Facebook policy. Scoble posted his original comment in its entirety <a href="https://plus.google.com/111091089527727420853/posts/cdZQPUiMp9b">on his Google+ page</a>, and it’s clear that it contains no profanity or even any obvious argumentative language.</p>\n<p>Of course, what makes a comment “positive” or “negative” is a very subjective thing. Since Facebook is a global site, and what is acceptable in one culture is offensive in another, the company generally relies on a combination of software algorithms and notifications from other users to identify inappropriate behavior. This seems to show a glitch in that system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This could be similar to what happened to film critic Roger Ebert back in January 2011, when Facebook <a href="http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/facebook-calls-roger-eberts-blog-abusive-content-125626">temporarily disabled</a> Ebert’s blog because of allegedly “abusive comment.” It turns out that Ebert’s blog never actually contained objectionable content — a number of Facebook users had <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/20/roger-ebert-jackass-drunk-driving/">flagged his page</a> as “abusive” after he wrote a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ebertchicago/status/82872136712192000">critical tweet</a> about Ryan Dunn, an actor who died in a drunk driving accident. It could be that Robert Scoble has been similarly flagged by other Facebook users, for reasons justified or not.</p>\n<p>Scoble’s a pretty popular guy on the web, so not surprisingly his <a href="https://plus.google.com/111091089527727420853/posts/cdZQPUiMp9b">Google+ post</a> about the incident attracted more than 100 comments within the first hour after he posted it. Several other people there report having seen the same message in recent days, and one person named <a href="https://plus.google.com/117689417145181059475/posts">Steven Streight</a> wrote that recently his Facebook commenting ability was “temporarily limited” because of comments that he says were similarly benign such as “I’m a married man.” TechCrunch commenters have weighed in on this post as well to recount <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/05/facebooks-positive-comment-policy-irrelevant-inappropriate-censorship/?fb_comment_id=fbc_10150805467643389_21913925_10150805930338389#f2656c5d706d17e">similar</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/05/facebooks-positive-comment-policy-irrelevant-inappropriate-censorship/?fb_comment_id=fbc_10150805467643389_21914067_10150805962773389#f24425e231e2184">experiences</a>.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, a number of people are seeing this as an example of censorship — a word that almost always has negative connotations in the tech world.</p>\n<p>We’ve reached out to Facebook for more information on what this policy means, how it is powered, and what specific words or behaviors it is meant to filter. We’ll update this post if we hear anything back and as the situation develops.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> A Facebook policy spokesperson emailed the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“To protect the millions of people who connect and share on Facebook every day, we have automated systems that work in the background to maintain a trusted environment and protect our users from bad actors who often use links to spread spam and malware. These systems are so effective that most people who use Facebook will never encounter spam. They’re not perfect, though, and in rare instances they make mistakes. This comment was mistakenly blocked as spammy, and we have already started to make adjustments to our classifier. We look forward to learning from rare cases such as these to make sure we don’t repeat the same mistake in the future.</p>\n<p>For more information about our spam prevention systems, please see this blog post: <a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=403200567130">https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=403200567130</a>.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also, my colleague Josh Constine has written a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/05/facebook-comment-limitations-are-a-spam-filter-not-censorship/">detailed report</a> on Facebook’s explanation on the situation, which can be found <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/05/facebook-comment-limitations-are-a-spam-filter-not-censorship/">here</a>.</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Z_lTrmdXRZZ8w5H3dvBGMLibyO0/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Z_lTrmdXRZZ8w5H3dvBGMLibyO0/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Z_lTrmdXRZZ8w5H3dvBGMLibyO0/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Z_lTrmdXRZZ8w5H3dvBGMLibyO0/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RUT3WDTBGzo" height="1" width="1" />'

Yodo1 is a market entry specialist and full service technology provider helping Western game developers successfully gain traction in the China mobile games market.</em></p>\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg’s visit to China back in December 2011 created a storm of speculation on whether Facebook was preparing for a full scale entry into the most populous country in the world. <a href="http://gadgetsrepublic.com/spotted-mark-zuckerberg-at-sina-hq">Photos</a> of Zuckerberg visiting Sina’s headquarters in Beijing, leaked by a Sina employee and reports of him meeting with other major Chinese Internet companies such as Baidu and Alibaba have further fueled rumors that Facebook is looking for a local partner to facilitate its China entry.</p>\n<p>Putting aside the rumors and speculation, there is little doubt that Facebook is looking for a way to enter the China market and the real questions lie not in the “if,” but rather the “how,” “when” and whether Facebook will be able to make a success of their China market entry when countless other western Internet juggernauts have bruised and battered themselves against the Great firewall of China.</p>\n<p><strong>License and Registration Number Please…</strong></p>\n<p>For Internet companies, the “rules” for playing in the China market are many and varied, the most basic of which includes the acquisition of an ICP (Internet Content Provider) license which only a local Chinese company can obtain. There are many ways and mechanisms via which Western companies can obtain this license, or at least obtain the rights to use it, the most popular of which is in the form of a set of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) agreements and structures. This mechanism is used by most of the local Chinese Internet companies that are listed overseas (hence making them non-local companies) and a good article explaining how VIE’s work in detail can be found <a href="http://www.chinaaccountingblog.com/weblog/explaining-vie-structures.html">here</a>, compliments of the China Accounting Blog.</p>\n<p>Besides the ICP, a broad based Social Network platform such as Facebook will require a whole bundle of other licenses based on different core functionality including but not limited to a Network Culture Operation License, which is required for all gaming platform operators. Also needed, an Internet Publication License, a requirement for video and photo sharing services, Payment Service Operator license required for Facebook’s credits service and likely dozens of other licenses from a multitude of different government departments including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)</li>\n<li>People’s Bank of China (PBoC)</li>\n<li>Ministry of Culture of the PRC</li>\n<li>The Information Office of the State Council of PRC</li>\n<li>The State Administration of Radio Film and Television</li>\n<li>The Ministry of Information Industry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To put things into perspective, here’s an example of the <a href="http://ir.vodone.com/html/about_licenses.php">licenses</a> that were obtained by a video broadcasting company operating in China and the scope of services provided by them is but a fraction of the services available on the Facebook platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Rewriting the Book of China Entry or Same Book Different Chapter?</strong></p>\n<p>Facebook’s formidable war chest of cash and equity value from their impending IPO provides alternatives for obtaining the relevant operating licenses through acquisition of local Chinese companies that already have them. However, this seemingly obvious path to a quicker China entry poses many other challenges, and one look at the trail of failed market entries by other leading Western Internet companies certainly paints an unfavorable picture.</p>\n<p>To provide perspective, let’s take a look at the China eCommerce space to get a feel of the challenges for leading Western players entering into China. eBay and Amazon have both tried their hand at the buy vs build approach to enter the market thru their respective acquisitions of Eachnet and Joyo. &nbsp;Amazon’s entry into China though unimpressive, can be categorized as a “success” on relative measures if you compare them against that of eBay, arguably the most high profile and widely published “failed” China entry in the Internet space. After eBay’s 2003 acquisition of EachNet, then the leading B2C provider in China, eBay successfully eroded EachNet’s user base and leadership position into a blip on the radar screen and handed China’s B2C market to Jack Ma’s Taobao. This market has now grown over 100 times in transaction volume since eBay’s initial entry in 2003.</p>\n<p>The reasons for eBay’s China failure are many and varied, but there are a number of relevant chapters from “eBay’s book of disasters” that Facebook can learn from in hopes of avoiding a similar fate. Chief among eBay’s fatal errors is that they failed to understand what the Chinese consumer really wanted from a B2C service, focusing instead on replicating their global model that had proven successful in Western markets to the Chinese community who’s shopping behavior, culture, product needs and purchasing power were extremely different to that of their Western counterparts. &nbsp;Concurrently, Jack Ma launched his B2C offensive with Taobao, a services that provided free listings with content and navigation tailored to the tastes of the local consumer. Today, Taobao is by far the dominant player in the B2C space and processes 79% of China’s online transaction value.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight for Past or Fight for the Future? &nbsp;Some Food for thought for Zuckerberg.</strong></p>\n<p>Some would argue that the war for dominance of Social Networking in China has already been fought and won, with major players such as Tencent, Sina and RenRen each claiming a significant slice of the Social Networking market, each leading in terms of specific demographics, features or access methods. The challenge for Facebook is that its broad platform of functionality competes directly and extensively with each of the above existing leaders in the market, though less so with Sina whose primary social asset is the Sina weibo services which is more competitive to a Twitter offering than a Facebook.</p>\n<p>Before deciding how Facebook should enter the Chinese market, a more relevant consideration for Zuckerberg is what markets does Facebook want to compete on in China. Given the plethora of regulatory challenges and the steep learning curve that the company is likely to face, it might make more sense for Facebook to choose a new battle ground that has yet to see an entrenched player in the market, but is significant enough that success in this area would provide a significant footprint for Facebook to leverage its other services into the region.</p>\n<p>One such market that might make sense for Facebook to target is the market for smartphone services. China already has the largest install base of smartphone handsets in the world with an estimated 100m units and projected doubling of unit shipments by the end of 2012. The battle for this rapidly growing access method has already started with Sina and Tencent duking it out via their respective mobile Weibo (microblogging) services and RenRen’s initiative to expand their traditional Social and gaming services onto the smartphone platforms. &nbsp;Facebook’s recent acquisition of Instagram provides an opportunity to leverage the app’s popularity among Chinese users as a potential route for a broader Facebook market entry in a way that is relatively non-threatening to Instagram’s Chinese partners such as Sina, whose social features are well integrated into the Chinese version of the app.</p>\n<p>At a macro level, the opportunity to dominant China’s smartphone market is HUGE, much bigger than what Instagram can provide today and potentially dwarfing the existing web-based social networking market in the coming years. Facebook and other players in the market have an opportunity against a limited time window to make a significant impact in this space where mobile social networking, smartphone payment methods, gaming and a number of other billion dollar plus markets are still in its infancy. What’s more, the smartphone platform war is an area that Facebook has yet to make a significant impact on in its home markets. The Chinese market can be a great way to experiment with new mobile services and business models quickly and cheaply in a market where there is only upside potential for Facebook.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4FQU-5CpiemJ1M6gsbhNvy1Kn6c/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4FQU-5CpiemJ1M6gsbhNvy1Kn6c/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4FQU-5CpiemJ1M6gsbhNvy1Kn6c/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4FQU-5CpiemJ1M6gsbhNvy1Kn6c/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/rFOiQfyM0S4" height="1" width="1" />'

As for the content: “water baths, homog­e­niz­ers, cen­trifuges, and ingre­di­ents such as hydro­col­loids, emul­si­fiers, and enzymes” are very much the norm in this book.</p>\n<p>In its most positive and optimistic light, the book and the whole effort gives a totally different spin to a man many commonly think of as a patent troll. As Men’s Journal writes: “If Myhrvold wants to bridge his ideas to reality and not be deemed a mere opportunist, or monsteret, what better route to the public’s love than through its stomach?”</p>\n<p>On a more cynical note: do you think Mhyrvold looked into whether any of these cooking ideas can be patented — and if so, have they been?</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0fhlbBfazGarNtYLzhMAao1Hz_A/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0fhlbBfazGarNtYLzhMAao1Hz_A/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0fhlbBfazGarNtYLzhMAao1Hz_A/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0fhlbBfazGarNtYLzhMAao1Hz_A/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/QGz8CRwrQ_M" height="1" width="1" />'

The Valley is abuzz with a hiring frenzy. Startups can’t compete with Yammer, Zynga, Twitter, Facebook and the rest for developers. Perhaps the answer is to look elsewhere? To countries where the old Soviet education system produced maths and science graduates by the truckload? To Kiev, Belgrade, Slovenia and others? And perhaps to Romania.</p>\n<p>For Romanians, perhaps for the first time in history, the world is now flat. Forty-five years of Stalin-esque communism meant sports and education were the only acceptable ways to compete in Romania. Soviet-era industrialisation ended up producing a country where almost half of the educated population were trained to become engineers. Today, in 2012, they are more likely to be coders. And now they can take their place with the rest of the world on the level playing field of technology.</p>\n<p>The best Romanian coding talent was noticed by Microsoft in its hay day. It’s now gradually becoming democratised, spread out across more platforms, initially through outsourcing and now through the influx of Western start-ups in search of affordable skills. So what exactly should you expect to find in Romania? What are the pros and cons? Here’s the lowdown, with some generalizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Culture</strong><br />\nPeople are smart, educated, fluent English speakers and resourceful lateral thinkers. On the downside, entrepreneurial culture has not yet developed. This translates into a reluctance to take risks and a lower ability to collaborate across teams. It might sound odd to Valley readers, but Romanian engineers would much rather work for a salary than for a stake in a business.</p>\n<p>There are some examples of local entrepreneurial communities, like the one formed around the Timisoara Tech Incubator or Startupper supported by the team of Adulmec in Bucharest. But the most impactful movement is the one involving start ups that left Romania, with the likes of Ubervu, Summify and Brainient.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong><br />\nThere is a discrepancy between skills. There is a lot of Java, .NET and PHP skills. More ‘exotic’ coding languages like Ruby, Python are harder to find. On the mobile side, there are considerably more Android coders than iOS developers.</p>\n<p>One appeal for many western startups that either set up shop in Romania or develop a team there is the ability to offer student internships straight out of university, pick the best and groom them with the kinds of skills that they need.</p>\n<p><strong>Rates</strong><br />\nSalaries are low in Romania compared with Berlin, London, Silicon Valley. This reflects the reduced access to opportunities and lack of exposure to cutting edge developments. You would expect to pay €2,000 (net) for a great developer in Bucharest. The rest of Romania is even cheaper, by about 30%. But beware of confusing the tax systems and bureaucracy.</p>\n<p><strong>Talent</strong><br />\nYou will find the largest tech communities in the historical university centers of Bucharest, Cluj, Timisoara &amp; Iasi. In Bucharest you have the largest and most diverse talent pool, but also a more competitive environment with higher volatility. In smaller communities there’s a stronger sense of reputation. Western cities like Timisoara and Cluj tend to have better work ethic.</p>\n<p>Finding really valuable engineers takes time. The general guidelines are to hire a ‘magnet coder’ that can attract other trusted people from the community. When recruiting, look for Polytechinc graduates from one of the above university centers. The most popular job sites are <a href="http://www.bestjobs.ro">Bestjobs.ro</a>, <a href="http://www.ejobs.ro">ejobs.ro</a> and <a href="http://www.jobber.ro">Jobber.ro</a>.</p>\n<p>The best screening for engineers is high school. There is a bit of an ‘Ivy League’ of high schools in Romania. These schools are focused on math and computer science. Every large city has one or two. Generally, people coming out of these top schools are no schmucks. Also, pay attention to see if they won any competitions and whether they had jobs or pet projects while still in school. University education in Romania, though thorough, tends not to encourage independent thought.</p>\n<p>Good Romanian engineers don’t like to be the 15th person down the chain working on a little piece of code or feel disconnected from the business. They are more likely to defect to another business if they don’t feel inspired by you or your company or the team you assemble. The real geniuses will do their own thing, just as anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Finally, the most appealing trait of Romanians is that they live on both sides of the brain. They have ingenuity and skill, a precious combination no matter where you find it. Soon know-how and self-belief will catch up and they will be on a truly level playing field, possibly for the first time ever.</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RNe_ACHRQF653goUg_Csg8ywGc/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RNe_ACHRQF653goUg_Csg8ywGc/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RNe_ACHRQF653goUg_Csg8ywGc/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RNe_ACHRQF653goUg_Csg8ywGc/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/SKiIVH1ru6I" height="1" width="1" />'

Previously, he helped launch New Charter University and was a founding member of Zinch, since acquired by Chegg.</em></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jailbreak</strong> <em>verb</em>. <strong>1</strong> To get out of a restricted mode of operation. <strong>2</strong> To enable use of a product not intended by the manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Currently, the degree is the only meaningful “unit” of education to which employers give any credence. Of this dependency, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967580,00.html">TIME magazine</a> writes, “The tight connection between college degrees and economic success may be a nearly unquestioned part of our social order. Future generations may look back and shudder at the cruelty of it… It is inefficient, both because it wastes a lot of money and because it locks people who would have done good work out of some jobs.”</p>\n<p>The traditional degree, with its four-year time commitment and steep price tag, made sense when the university centrally aggregated top academic minds with residency-based students. Education required extensive logistics, demanding deep commitment from students worthy of being rewarded with the all-or-nothing degree.</p>\n<p>But education isn’t all-or-nothing. College and its primary credential, the degree, needn’t be either. The benefit of modern, online education is that the burden of logistics and infrastructure are greatly reduced, allowing for the potential of a fluid, lifelong education model. The problem, to date, is that formal, online education is still being packaged in all-or-nothing degree programs, falsely constraining education innovation. <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/101620/higher-education-accreditation-MIT-university">The New Republic</a> writes, “Online for-profit colleges haven’t disrupted the industry because while their business methods are different, their product—traditional credentials in the form of a degree—is not.”</p>\n<p>Technology creates efficiencies by decreasing unit size while increasing utility. &nbsp;To falsely constrain anything to historically larger canons is to render technology impotent to do what it does best.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edq07biGpC0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">Clayton Christensen</a> predicts, “I bet what happens as [higher education] becomes more modular is that accreditation occurs at the level of the course, not the university; so they can then offer degrees as collection of the best courses taught in the world. A barrier that historically kept people out of university [is] blown away by the modularization and the change in [course-by-course] accreditation.”</p>\n<p>With education, there is a particularly strong analog to what iTunes and the digital single did to the album:<br />\n</p>\n<p>Why buy a whole album when I only value a few songs enough to purchase? Why am I required to finance an entire degree only to be forced to take courses that I do not value? By bundling education into its most popular format, the four-year degree, we are inevitably adding low-utility courses that the consumer should be enabled to avoid.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/stop-stealing-dreams">Seth Godin</a> writes, “Transparency in… school might destroy it. If we told the truth about the irrelevance of various courses, about the relative quality of some teachers, about the power of choice… could the school as we know it survive?”</p>\n<p>To be explicit, in seeking to evolve beyond the four-year degree we need not be anti-college. iTunes didn’t render the musician irrelevant just the album. But just as Napster, YouTube, iTunes and Spotify evolved the paths, careers, and distribution of musicians and their music, the role that the university plays will evolve dramatically.</p>\n<p>It is easy to imagine a few years from now looking at a chart similar to the one above, only seeing the numbers of people taking individual courses exploding as the complete-degree programs careen towards zero.</p>\n<p>Jailbreaking the degree and making courses the “unit” of education will unlock a flood of unmet demand and a new wave of possibilities in how we learn and consume education.</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RTOQrSdBDwRT-OI0SnKoBYKRC4/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RTOQrSdBDwRT-OI0SnKoBYKRC4/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RTOQrSdBDwRT-OI0SnKoBYKRC4/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/0RTOQrSdBDwRT-OI0SnKoBYKRC4/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Nsl9dWtFmtQ" height="1" width="1" />'

It basically allows owners of Android phones to load custom ROMs onto their phones in exchange for any warranty rights they may have been enjoying. </p>\n<p>It’s a fair trade considering a solid percentage of Android power users prefer Android based mostly on the fact that they have this option, but without solid hardware the ability to load different versions of Androids becomes less and less appealing. </p>\n<p>And so is the case with the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/04/some-guys-have-all-the-luck-htc-one-x-hitting-doorsteps-ahead-of-schedule/">HTC One X</a>. It’s an excellent handset, and possibly the best HTC has ever made. But unfortunately, the company won’t be offering the bootloader unlock tool for this particular handset. </p>\n<p>Here’s the official word from HTC, according to <a href="http://www.modaco.com/page/news/_/android/htc-on-the-att-one-x-bootloader-lock-r483">MoDaCo</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>HTC is committed to listening to users and delivering customer satisfaction. Since announcing our commitment to unlockable bootloaders, HTC has worked to enable our customers to unlock the bootloader on more than 45 devices over the past six months. In some cases, however, restrictions prevent certain devices from participating in our bootloader unlocking program. Rest assured, HTC is committed to assisting developers in unlocking bootloaders for HTC devices and we’ll continue to unlock additional devices in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>HTC is right to point out the number of handsets it has offered this functionality with, and it certainly seems a bit odd that its current flagship device wouldn’t receive the same treatment. <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/19465/news/htc-one-x-for-att-unable-to-use-bootloader-unlock-tools">MobileBurn</a> suspects that AT&amp;T may have something to do with this restriction, and I’m inclined to agree. </p>\n<p>After all, it wouldn’t be the first time that we’ve seen carriers tamper with a handset’s functionality for their own, sometimes unexplained, reasons. Remember when Verizon <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/06/verizon-couldnt-be-more-full-of-it/">blocked Google Wallet on the GalNex</a> based on what was most certainly the carrier’s support for a rival NFC payment system called ISIS? </p>\n<p>We’ve reached out to AT&amp;T to figure out whether or not the big blue carrier is, in fact, responsible for this unfortunate turn of events. We’ll keep you posted once we know more. </p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/b7DP3UF1D_h8lQp6KRbxlr0aHZE/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/b7DP3UF1D_h8lQp6KRbxlr0aHZE/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/b7DP3UF1D_h8lQp6KRbxlr0aHZE/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/b7DP3UF1D_h8lQp6KRbxlr0aHZE/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/lnQk88QbSn8" height="1" width="1" />'

But that’s not why Tampa was chosen as the next major metro area to join the lineup of ZocDoc’s regions served – the company says that it chooses new markets based on demand from both patients and doctors alike.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the launch, ZocDoc also released the findings from a new survey it commissioned which highlights why ZocDoc happens to be in such demand: it’s solving the frustrating problem of finding a doctor and booking an appointment – something which the youngest generation of patients is apparently the most ill-equipped to handle, at least according to the findings.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar with the company, ZocDoc, which has now raised $95 million in funding, is solving a very real world problem of finding a doctor, dentist or health care professional in your area and then setting an appointment with them. It’s typicallly a frustrating process, especially for digitally connected folks annoyed at having to navigate phone menus, then wait on hold, only to find out the doctor isn’t even available for weeks on out. With ZocDoc, patients can instead just go online to book appointments – even same-day appointments – and they can see the real-time availability of doctors in their area, confirm who accepts their insurance, and read the feedback and reviews of doctors from other patients.</p>\n<p>For doctors, ZocDoc integrates with their calendaring systems in real-time while also helping them tap into the 10% to 20% of appointments that are cancelled or rescheduled at the last minute.</p>\n<p>In a Harris Interactive survey conducted on ZocDoc’s behalf, the company found that the digitally connected group known as Gen Y (in this case, those aged 18-34) generally finds the whole process of dealing with health care frustrating (54%), feels at the mercy of the doctors’ office staff (63%), and are often so put off by the process (over half said), that they actually delay getting their health care needs dealt with. Ouch.</p>\n<p>Plus, even though this group is only 23% of the population, they’re the largest group of smartphone and tablet owners. In fact, they’re so comfortable with using technology to do things, that they find pretty much everything else easier to do than book a doctor’s appointment. 79% said they can evaluate a new gadget easier than finding a doc, for example, and 76% said they can find a hotel room easier than finding a doc. Meanwhile, 64% said they have no clue how to pick out a doctor and 79% admitted they picked a doctor based on whether or not they accept their insurance.</p>\n<p>Tampa now joins ZocDoc’s ever-growing lineup of U.S. metro areas, which also includes Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami-Palm Beach, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.&nbsp;Founded in 2007, today more than 1.2 million people use the service each month to book a doctor or dentist.

In addition to MSNBC, “footage” from the battle ran on CNN, local Time Warner Cable channel NY1 and ABC affiliate WABC ( we didn’t see any real anchors, just clips and an interview with a “witness”). There were also some fictional TV networks, including a fake channel 5, which is a Fox affiliate here in New York. We also noticed that the only cable news channel not featured was Fox News Channel.”</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\nNow you may be wondering WHY Fox News, who is certainly not shy about self promotion, would not have their name prominently displayed throughout this movie? Good question.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nA possible reason for this might be that Disney, who is distributing this movie hates Fox news, or perhaps that Fox News hates them back.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nOr it could be <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/fox-news-spiderman.html">this</a>:<br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>Fox News has accused the left of forcing Marvel to “take a radical left turn to extreme political correctness” by making the new Spider-Man half black and half Hispanic.</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\nMarvel, which is also the comic book company behind the Avengers, is undoubtedly sensitive about having one of their most iconic characters attacked in this way, so that might very well have something to do with the fact that the movie now portrays Fox as being perhaps the ONLY cable news network that would not consider the saving of New York by a group of colorfully garbed super heroes to be newsworthy.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nUndoubtedly Fox was too busy covering another socialist political move by President Obama, or reporting on how a white person exercised&nbsp; their first amendment rights by delivering justice through the barrel of a gun to some poor minority that walked too close to their house, or perhaps they were busy making sure that the stupidity falling out of Sarah Palin's mouth was broadcast into the homes of unsuspecting Americans.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nYeah I know that it will probably not have any real impact on Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes, or the shareholders of Newscorp.&nbsp; After all they have a Hannity, an O'Reilly, and a Van Susteren as their own personal "superheroes," assuming of course that blatant lies and obfuscation can be considered a super power that is.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nWell personally I am very excited about attending this move today. Because even though Fox News may have an army of brainwashed paint chip eaters who are still ignorant enough to support them, those of us who are NOT seeing a Leftist agenda behind every corner have something much more exciting, we have a Hulk!<br />\015\n<br />\015\n<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="259" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MMpCCo8Evnc" width="450"></iframe>\015\nOh boy, I can taste the popcorn already!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9361564-6983080526766486773?l=theimmoralminority.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>"

(Not helpful: The 2005 MySpace page where he wrote “I dont miss driving around scared to hit mexicans walkin on the side of the street, soft ass wanna be thugs messin with peoples cars.”) Zimmerman isn’t going dark online, however. Instead, his defense lawyer, Mark O’Mara, started up a new Web page for his client this week, with Facebook and Twitter accounts to go with it.&nbsp;</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\n<i>O’Mara noticed that Zimmerman had raised $204,000 from a website he started in April, and the new page will raise money, too. More interestingly, O’Mara said that social media will be his tool for responding quickly and efficiently to “misinformation” about his client and the case. If his strategy works, O’Mara will be the Sarah Palin of defense lawyers: The guy who changed the legal publicity game via the Twitter and Facebook blast.</i><br />\015\n<br />\015\nInterestingly enough I am not sure who this comparison hurts more, Sarah Palin or George Zimmerman? <br />\015\n<br />\015\nHowever it is interesting to note how far Palin's brand has fallen, in that now her name can be attached to one of the most racially divisive, and politically sensitive cases in the news today, and that it may further damage George Zimmerman's defense to have that be so.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nHowever it is an apt comparison in that Palin did indeed utilize the internet in an attempt to reinvent herself, while staying away from attempts to by the news media to cross examine her and reveal the pathology buried behind hr media persona. <br />\015\n<br />\015\nIt might be worth noting to Mr. O'Mara that in the end it did NOT work in Palin's favor.&nbsp; While, much like Zimmerman, she was able to retain her hard Right Wing fan base, her ugly personality managed to shine through in anti-Obama diatribes and defensive soliloquies (Think Blood Libel) which essentially destroyed any chance she had of ever being seen as sympathetic by reasonable, rational people.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nWhich of course is why we now see her name attached, even in a tenuous way, to such an incredibly racially provocative and emotionally sensitive case.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nAnd you know, now that I think about it, this really does hurt Zimmerman more than it hurts the Palin brand.&nbsp; I don't believe the Palin brand can get much lower.<br />\015\n<br />\015\nWell, that is until we see Bristol's new reality shows hit the airwaves of course.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9361564-3677572723498593137?l=theimmoralminority.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>"

(Especially compared to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/31/freight-train-kept-a-rollin/">last year</a>.) Apple’s iPhone is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/24/apples-iphone-sales-in-china-are-up-by-fivefold-from-a-year-ago/">soaring in China</a>, and apparently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/26/apple-will-one-day-rule-the-world/">overtaking Android</a> in the crucial American market. Oracle’s lawsuit against Google has led to several rather awkward claims, eg that the word ‘license’ in the phrase “we need to negotiate a license for Java under the terms we need” <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/04/19/lindholm.says.google.didnt.mean.it.owed.money/">referred to</a> “not a license from anybody”, a kind of license with which I was previously entirely unfamiliar. CEO Larry Page’s own testimony was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-oracle-page-20120419,0,401138.story">labelled as</a> evasive: “His denial of knowledge and recollection contrasts with evidence,” wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_M%C3%BCller">Florian Mueller</a> of <a href="http://fosspatents.com/">FOSS Patents</a>.</p>\n<p>What a headache. Way back in 2005, Android head honcho Andy Rubin wrote in a <a href="http://java.dzone.com/news/key-emails-could-be-evidence">prescient email</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If Sun doesn’t want to work with us, we have two options: 1) Abandon our work and adopt MSFT CLR VM and C# language – or – 2) Do Java anyway and defend our decision, perhaps making enemies along the way.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just imagine if they’d taken the first road. It’s not widely understood in the industry that Microsoft’s .NET <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> is more open than Java in many ways; it and its flagship language C# are ISO and ECMA standards, available to anyone and everyone, legally bulletproofed by the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/cp/default.mspx">Microsoft Community Promise</a>. Imagine if the Android OS ran on an entirely different technical architecture.</p>\n<p>Wait, no. Don’t imagine it: examine it. Like a vision from a parallel universe, it now exists.</p>\n<p>Way back in 2001, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Icaza">Miguel de Icaza</a> realized that if he ported .NET to Linux, he would open Linux up to a huge new developer community — and vice versa. The <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono Project</a> was born. it wound up in Novell’s hands, where it continued to mature. Last year much of the Mono team founded a company called <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, whose MonoTouch software lets developers write native Android/iOS apps using .NET technologies.</p>\n<p>Android apps run on Google’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_%28software%29">Dalvik</a> virtual machine. “Dalvik’s fairly immature, and Mono vastly outperforms it,” says Xamarin’s CEO Nat Friedman. “So we started thinking: hey, what if we translated the entire Android OS to C#? It would run faster, and it wouldn’t have any legal problems.”</p>\n<p>First it was just a thought experiment. Then it became more of a science project. And then the Xamarin team <a href="http://blog.xamarin.com/2012/05/01/android-in-c-sharp/">actually <i>did</i> it</a>, by adopting and improving a tool named Sharpen that translates Java to C#, and using it to translate the entire Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) codebase. They did get a few side benefits — that improved tool, and better graphics handling — but mostly they did it for fun, aka the love of making something better. Oh, and they’ve now <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/XobotOS">open-sourced the whole thing</a>, under the name of XobotOS.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? Good question. Maybe it’s an impressive technical achievement that’s ultimately inconsequential except as a bright feather in Xamarin’s cap. (If the idea was to get developers’ attention, they’ve certainly succeeded.) Maybe it’s Plan B for Google, in case there is some (unlikely) legal catastrophe.</p>\n<p>And maybe the next company that thinks about forking Android for their own use — as Amazon did with the Kindle Fire, and as RIM had to have at least considered last year — will decide to go the Xobot route, for better performance, for legal cover, as a major differentiator, and to appeal to the huge and thriving .NET developer community. On the other hand, existing apps would either have to run on the <a href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM</a> virtual machine atop Mono (after tweaking it to handle Dalvik .dex files) which would mean a performance hit, or be Sharpened to C# and recompiled. </p>\n<p>Still, at the very least, it’s a technically impressive and interesting feat. And who knows? Watch this space. It just might turn out to be a genuinely disruptive one as well.</p>\n<br />         \n<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t4BU4K-n7egV8xKLu8mKCroTe-g/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t4BU4K-n7egV8xKLu8mKCroTe-g/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t4BU4K-n7egV8xKLu8mKCroTe-g/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t4BU4K-n7egV8xKLu8mKCroTe-g/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/kg1owvikJAw" height="1" width="1" />'
